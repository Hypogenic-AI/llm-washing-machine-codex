\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We asked whether ``washing machine'' corresponds to a distinct residual-stream feature in \gpttwo or emerges from composition of constituents. Using \sae overlap, causal patching, and compositional probes, we find low sparse feature overlap, no reliable patching lift, and near-perfect compositional predictability. The key takeaway is that compound concepts can be strongly compositional even when no single sparse feature dominates at the tested layer.

Future work should expand context coverage with larger corpora, analyze multiple layers and \sae locations, and test larger models to evaluate how compositional storage scales.
