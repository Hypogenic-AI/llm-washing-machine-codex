\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We tested whether \compound is stored as a distinct residual direction or emerges from constituent features in \gpttwo. Using \sae overlap analysis, causal patching, and compositional probing, we find weak evidence for a single-layer atomic feature and strong evidence for compositional predictability. The key takeaway is that compound meanings appear to be constructed rather than stored as a single direction at the tested layer. Future work should expand to larger corpora, additional layers, multi-layer \sae models, and compounds with varying degrees of idiomaticity.
