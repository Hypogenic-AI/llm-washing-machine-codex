\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
\para{Main metrics.} \Tabref{tab:main_results} reports overlap, cosine, causal patching, and probe metrics. Top-$k$ overlap between compound and constituent contexts is low (Jaccard 0.11--0.14), and bootstrap means remain between 0.09 and 0.11, indicating limited shared sparse features. In contrast, the compositionality probe reconstructs compound embeddings with mean cosine 0.996 and MSE 5.19, a large improvement over the \wbaseline baseline (MSE 12.49).

\para{SAE overlap and patching plots.} \Figref{fig:sae_overlap} visualizes overlap distributions, while \Figref{fig:causal_patching} summarizes patching outcomes. Patching compound residuals into ``washing process'' contexts yields a mean $\Delta$logit of $-0.019$ with high variance ($\pm 0.109$) across five template pairs.

\para{Statistical context.} The patching result is not significant ($p=0.75$) and uses $n=5$ template pairs, so we interpret it as weak evidence against a single dominant compound feature at this layer.
