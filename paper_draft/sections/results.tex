\para{SAE feature overlap is low.} \Tabref{tab:main_metrics} shows that compound--constituent top-50 Jaccard overlaps are 0.11--0.14, and 68\% of compound features are unique relative to constituent top-50 sets. \Figref{fig:sae_overlap} visualizes the overlap patterns, reinforcing the weak feature sharing signal.

\para{Compositionality probe is strong.} The ridge probe predicts compound embeddings from constituents with cosine 0.996 and MSE 5.19, outperforming the head-noun (w2) baseline (MSE 12.49), a 58.4\% reduction. This indicates that compound representations are largely reconstructible from constituents despite low \sae overlap.

\para{Causal patching shows weak effects.} Patching \compound activations into \washing process prompts at layer 6 does not increase the logit for ``machine'' (mean $\Delta$logit $-0.019 \pm 0.109$, $n=5$). \Figref{fig:causal_patching} shows the distribution of patching effects and their variability across templates.
